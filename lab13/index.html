<h1> Problems</h1>
</div>
<p>I ran into numerous problems, one of them being adding a background image, finding the correct font for the numbers, it also moved my text lower than it should be and it is not staying in fram, it seems to duplicate even though I tied to "contain" it in my css and html.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>
</div>
<p> I was not vey satisfied with my results because I feel like they could have been better, I did try to improve it but anytime I wpuld change things it would only make it worse or not chnage at all. You can see my results below and how it did not come out as expected.</p>
