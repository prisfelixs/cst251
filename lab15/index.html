<h1> Challenge </h1>
</div>
<p>The main challenge for this lab was to use fancy css like a gradient for the backround, filter to an image and rounded corners to an image. </p>

<p>The main problems I had were making sure the output was correct and making the rounded corners.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>
</div>
<p> It took me a couple tries to make sure the output was correct. I had to go back a couple of times to revise my code in order forthe output to be correct because I had forgotten to close one of my tags. I also had to play around with the rounded corners element because it was not coming out correct, but I refered back to the lecture slides for help. Overall I felt like this lab was fun and simple.</p>
