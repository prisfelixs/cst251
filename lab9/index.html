<h1> Challenges</h1>
<p>The main challenge for me was making sure I was styling the block elements correctly. I felt like it was simple to add it in to the css style sheet but the real challenge was actually getting the output correct.</p>

<h1> Problems</h1>
<p> The main problems I had was getting the correct output, there was times where I styled block elements but it was not coming out the way I wanted it to. I struggled with trying to center my "Lab 9" title and in the end did not figure this out But I was able to center my image correctly. I also struggled centering my "back to homepage" link.  </p>

<h1> Results</h1>
<p>My results were not too bad, I worked with what I knew and the outcomes checked off all that was needed for the tasks on this lab. Although I wish my set up of this page looked a bit different I am still satisfied witht the outcomes. I have provided an image below to show these efforts.</p>
