<h1> Challenge</h1>
<p> The main challenge for this lab was styling elements in the lab 8 css stylesheet and get the image to zoom in when the mouse hovers over it, I felt like it was very easy to do.</p>

<div class="topic">
<h1> Problems</h1>
	<p> I did not run into too many problems, the most difficult part was just figuring out how to get the image to zoom but it was not hard to figure out.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="topic">
<h1> Results</h1>
<p>Below is an example of my results. I played around with the css stylesheet and styled the elements the way I wanted to, if you hover the mouse over the image you can see the image zooms in and i did this all in my css stylesheet. </p>

<div id="dog" class="zoom">
