	<h1> File Transfer </h1>
	<p> In Lab 4 we learned about file transfers. This included learning what a file transfer is, testing locally,local vs server, and file transfer protocol.</p>
	<h1> Testing Files Locally</h1>
	<p> Before uploading to the server I had to test my files locally to make sure the files were working correctly.</p>
