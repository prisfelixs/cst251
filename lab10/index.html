 <div class="heading">
<h1> Challenge </h1>
</div>
<p> The main challenge for this lab was to style the text elements by changing the color, size and font, etc. </p>

	<div class="heading">
<h1> Problems</h1>
</div>
<p> I did not have any problems with this lab, I felt like it was very easy. It was easy and fun customizing the page to my liking.</p>

	<div class="heading">
<h1>Results</h1>
</div>
<p>This page is an example of my results. I am very happy with them. I used a google font that I really liked and I also used Adobe Color to help me pick colors that would go well together but would still be easy to read by checking the contrast ratio.</p>
